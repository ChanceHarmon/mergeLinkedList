# mergeLinkedList

# Challenge Summary
Merge two linked lists

## Challenge Description
In place, merge two unsorted linked lists into one linked list, making linked list 1 the final linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
I knew i had to be storing the head node from list two before i could make that node equal to the next node in the other link list. I just never figured it out. I get the idea, but the wording is lost at the moment. I used two files to show the two different ideas I could find that I may be able to get to work, but they both have odd errors that I wasn't able to work through yet. Unsorted is the key for this, but that is what makes it a challenege.
